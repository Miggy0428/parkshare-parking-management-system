**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive Firebase configuration validation
- Implemented proper error handling for missing/invalid credentials
- Added fallback mechanisms for development without proper Firebase setup
- Enhanced TypeScript typing for all Firebase exports

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/firebase.ts` - Complete rewrite with validation and error handling
- `src/lib/firebase-service.ts` - Updated to use proper getter functions
